# Java imports

This merger does a better job merging `import` statements than other tools do.
It handles conflicts in `import` statements, keeping all the necessary imports.
It also prevents a merge from removing a needed `import` statement, even if the
merge would be clean.

If the only conflicts are in import statements, or there are no conflicts, then:
 * Resolve conflicts by unioning the imports, being careful not to
   lose comments that appear within the conflict.
 * Reinster all `import` statements that were removed by a clean
   merge.
 * Remove all unneeded imports.  A needed import is one that is used
   somewhere in the Java file.

Here is an example:

```
BASE:          EDIT 1:         EDIT 2:

import A.a;    import A.a;    import A.a;
               import B.b;    import C.c;     // different additions; git considers this a conflict
import D.d;    import D.d;    import D.d;
import E.e;                   import E.e;     // edit 1 removed, but edit 2 still needs
import F.f;    import F.f;    import F.f;
import G.g;                   import G.g;     // edit 1 removed, and edit 2 does not need
import H.h;    import H.h;    import H.h;
import I.i;                                   // neither edit needs "I"
import J.j;    import J.j;    import J.j;
```

`merge-imports` merges the above edits in the way a programmer would want:
retain "B", "C", and "E", but do not retain "G" or "I".

```
MERGED:

import A.a;
import B.b;
import C.c;
import D.d;
import E.e;
import F.f;
import H.h;
import J.j;
```
