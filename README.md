# merge-tools

This project contains git merge drivers and git merge tools.

Currently some only work on Java files, and some are more general.

Currently they are relatively slow:  about 1/3 second per Java file that was
modified in both versions to be merged.  Most merges involve few Java files that
were modified in both versions, but if there are many, the merge will be slow.


## Features

* [Java imports](README-java-imports.md):  This handles conflicts in `import`
statements, keeping all the necessary imports.  It also prevents a merge from
removing a needed `import` statement, even if the merge would be clean.

* [Java annotations](README-java-annotations.md):  This resolves conflicts in
favor of retaining a Java annotation, when the only textual difference is in
annotations.

* [Adjacent lines](README-adjacent-lines.md): This resolves conflicts when the two edits
only affect different lines.  By default, git considers edits to different,
adjacent lines to be a conflict.

You can enable and disable each feature individually, or enable just one feature.
These command-line arguments are supported by the merge driver
`java-merge-driver.sh` and the merge tool `java-merge-tool.sh`.
 * `--imports`, `--no-imports`, `--only-imports` [default: enabled]
 * `--annotations`, `--no-annotations`, `--only-annotations` [default: enabled]
 * `--adjacent`, `--no-adjacent`, `--only-adjacent` [default: disabled]


## How to use


### Common setup

0. You must have Java 17 or later installed.

1. Clone this repository.

2. In the top level of this repository, run: `./gradlew shadowJar`

3. Put directory `.../merge-tools/src/main/sh/` on your PATH,
adjusting "..." according to where you cloned this repository.
After changing a dotfile to set PATH, you may need to log out
and log back in again to have the change take effect.
(Or, use the absolute pathname in uses of `*.sh` files below.)


### How to use as a merge driver

After performing the following steps, git will automatically use this merge
driver for every merge of Java files.

1. In your `~/.gitconfig` file (or in a repository's `.git/config` file,
to take effect for only that repository), add:

```
[merge "merge-java"]
        name = Merge Java files
        driver = java-merge-driver.sh "%A" "%O" "%B"
```

2. In a gitattributes file, add:

```
*.java merge=merge-java
```

To enable this for a single repository, add this to the repository's `.gitattributes` file.
(Or to its `.git/info/attributes` file, in which case it won't be committed with the project.)

To enable this for all repositories, add this to your your user-level
gitattributes file.  The user-level gitattributes file is by default
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes`.  You can change the user-level file to be
`~/.gitattributes` by running the following command, once ever per computer:
`git config --global core.attributesfile '~/.gitattributes'`


### How to use as a merge tool

First, edit your `~/.gitconfig` file as shown below.

Run the following after a git merge that leaves conflicts:

```
yes | git mergetool --tool=merge-java
```

The reason for `yes |` is that `git mergetool` stops and asks after each file
that wasn't perfectly merged.  This question is not helpful, the `-y` and
`--no-prompt` command-line arguments do not suppress it, and it's tedious to
keep typing "y".


#### `~/.gitconfig` setup for use as a merge tool

There is just one step for setup.

1. In your `~/.gitconfig` file, add:

```
[merge]
# Show original in addition to the two conflicting edits.
        conflictstyle = zdiff3

[merge]
        tool = merge-java

[mergetool.merge-java]
        cmd = java-merge-tool.sh "${BASE}" "${LOCAL}" "${REMOTE}" "${MERGED}"
        trustExitCode = true
```


## Git merge terminology

A **merge driver** is automatically called during `git merge` whenever no two of
{base,edit1,edit2} are the same.  It writes a merged file, which may or may not
contain conflict markers.

A **merge tool** is called manually by the programmer.  For each file that
contains conflict markers, the merge tool runs and observes the base, edit1,
edit2, and the conflicted merge (which the merge tool can overwrite with a new
merge result).  If the merge driver produced a clean merge for a given file,
then the merge tool is not run on the file.

After running `git merge` (and perhaps manually resolving some of the
conflicts), you might run a merge tool to resolve further conflicts.
